# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Instructions to run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: "git clone https://github.com/DipankarKapoor/Music-Player"
2. Ensure you have Node installed on your computer and in VS Code navigate to the downloaded directory.
3. Run the command: "npm i"
4. This will install all the dependencies necessary to run the project.
5. Run the following command to view the project: "npm run dev"
6. The project uses Vite, running the command will return you a localhost link, Ctrl + Click to view the website :)
